## Registration 

This year there will again be a registration form so that we can better estimate how many sleeping places and food is needed and so that we can better organize the hike.

**People who are coming with the Solibus do not need to register.**

## 💸❄️ Crowdfunding launched! ❄️💸

Although much of our work is based on solidarity and we rely on the cooperation of many volunteers and collectives, there are costs every year that we can only cover through crowdfunding.

❤️We depend on you and are grateful for every contribution!❤️

## 🏛️ The Federal Court has made an important decision protecting the right to demonstrate! 🎉

In 2023, we filed a complaint against the conditions imposed on the then Strike WEF Winterhike.

The authorities refused to give the march an appropriate route along the road and sent us on hidden trails.

We are not protesting for ourselves, but to show those who believe that money and power can protect them that we will not stand by in silence.

And now the Federal Supreme Court has ruled in our favour. Protest must be visible!
An important victory, but it's not enough for us. We need as many people as possible to show the rich and powerful that we will fight the #Worldeconomicfailure.

More information on Instagram or in the [media release](https://www.djs-jds.ch/de/djs-schweiz/aktivitaeten/medienmittteilungen/bundesgericht-bestaetigt-unzulaessiger-eingriff-in-die-meinungs-und-versammlungsfreiheit-durch-buendner-behoerden-die-wef-winderwanderung-haette-auf-der-kantonsstrasse-bewilligt-werden-muessen) of the Democratic Lawyers Switzerland!
