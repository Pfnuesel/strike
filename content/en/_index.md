## Registration form

We have created another registration form so that we can better estimate how many sleeping places and food are needed and so that we can better organise the hike.

[Click here for the Form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/RZ26oYBpGnROlw1vbbMWYz0LoyyoRnucAUjT1RzCbGY/)

Registration will close on 17.01, around 20:00. However, this does not mean that you should not come! 
Under Info/Route&Times you will find all times to join us on Sunday!We look forward to seeing you!

## Sleeping place situation

### Before/after the hike

The sleeping places are located in Zurich and are very limited and (unfortunately9 already overcrowded. Therefore, they are no longer available in the registration form.
If you can find another place to sleep, we would be very grateful. If you can't find anything, please contact us by e-mail and we will try to find a solution

### During the hike

During the hike we have 2 gyms with space for up to 400 people. 
One is located in Klosters and the second in the neighbouring village of Fideris. If you have a GA or Half-Fare travelcard, consider whether the second gym is suitable for you. This way, people with little money can save on a train ticket. We thank you for this!

## 🏛️ The Federal Court has made an important decision protecting the right to demonstrate! 🎉

In 2023, we filed a complaint against the conditions imposed on the then Strike WEF Winterhike.

The authorities refused to give the march an appropriate route along the road and sent us on hidden trails.

We are not protesting for ourselves, but to show those who believe that money and power can protect them that we will not stand by in silence.

And now the Federal Supreme Court has ruled in our favour. Protest must be visible!
An important victory, but it's not enough for us. We need as many people as possible to show the rich and powerful that we will fight the #Worldeconomicfailure.

## 🚀❄️ Dear friends of the WEF resistance!
## The winter wind will be blowing soon and our anti-WEF banners with it! :) 🔥🧡💜
### From 18. to 19. of January 2025


Unfortunately, the WEF is not history yet this year either. Capitalists, dictators and other exploiters of our world will once again be shaking hands in Davos over an aperitif. So, what are we waiting for when they are all together?


Let's go, let's go on a winter hike against the WEF! But for that we need your support: we need motivated people to organise infrastructure, mobilisation, social media, finances, etc. We can't do this without you and you don't need any previous experience to join.


Do you want to help us abolish the WEF? Then write us a PM or an email to (strike.wef@posteo.de). We look forward to your message!
