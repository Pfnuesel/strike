# It's time to hike to Davos again!

Every year, representatives of large corporations, politicians and scientists gather at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to discuss global issues. They claim to be saving the world. But their own interests are at the forefront. While the super-rich and corporations represented at the WEF continue to increase their wealth, billions of people are suffering from poverty, inequality and the consequences of climate change. 

We stand up for social justice, fight for a world in which everyone has enough to live on and campaign for an economy that puts people's needs first.
