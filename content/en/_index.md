## 🚀❄️ Dear friends of the WEF resistance!
## The winter wind will be blowing soon and our anti-WEF banners with it! :) 🔥🧡💜
### From 17. to 18. of January 2026


Unfortunately, the WEF is not history yet this year either. Capitalists, dictators and other exploiters of our world will once again be shaking hands in Davos over an aperitif. So, what are we waiting for when they are all together?


Let's go, let's go on a winter hike against the WEF! But for that we need your support: we need motivated people to organise infrastructure, mobilisation, social media, finances, etc. We can't do this without you and you don't need any previous experience to join.


Do you want to help us abolish the WEF? Then write us a PM or an email to (strike.wef@posteo.de). We look forward to your message!

## 🏛️ The Federal Court has made an important decision protecting the right to demonstrate! 🎉

In 2023, we filed a complaint against the conditions imposed on the then Strike WEF Winterhike.

The authorities refused to give the march an appropriate route along the road and sent us on hidden trails.

We are not protesting for ourselves, but to show those who believe that money and power can protect them that we will not stand by in silence.

And now the Federal Supreme Court has ruled in our favour. Protest must be visible!
An important victory, but it's not enough for us. We need as many people as possible to show the rich and powerful that we will fight the #Worldeconomicfailure.
