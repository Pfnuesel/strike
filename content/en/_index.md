## Important Update

The local authorities and police continue to discourage our presence on the cantonal road this year. Negotiations are ongoing, preventing us from confirming the exact route at this time.

Due to the municipality's interference, regrettably, we've had to make time adjustments to our plans!

All infos regarding the route & meeting points you can find here:

## It's time to hike to Davos again!

Every year, representatives of large corporations, politicians and scientists gather at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to discuss global issues. They claim to be saving the world. But their own interests are at the forefront. While the super-rich and corporations represented at the WEF continue to increase their wealth, billions of people are suffering from poverty, inequality and the consequences of climate change. 

We stand up for social justice, fight for a world in which everyone has enough to live on and campaign for an economy that puts people's needs first.

You can find out more under ["Why are we hiking against the WEF?"]({{< ref "/hike/why.md" >}} "Why")
