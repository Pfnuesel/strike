## Thank you for hiking with us!

We successfully carried the protest to Davos!
Despite the undesirable route, we made it to Davos and were able to make a statement against bigwigs and climate killers.

Despite excessive inspections by the police in Davos against peaceful demonstrators, we were able to be loud!

_Venceremos_
