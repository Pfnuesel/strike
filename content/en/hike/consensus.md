### Action consensus WEF hike 2024

To ensure that the winter hike is transparent and assessable for all participants, we have drawn up an action consensus:

- We respect the personal boundaries of other activists. Violence against living beings of any kind and endangering them is rejected as a form of action. We understand violence to mean anything that causes pain to the other person, whether psychological or physical. We do not encourage escalation, nor will we engage in provocation.
- Damage to property is not part of this campaign. Our walk is intended to convey an image of diversity, creativity and openness. We come from different social movements and political spectrums. Together we will take responsibility for the success of the walk.
- During and after the hike, we will act in solidarity and support each other even if the hike is met with repression and legal problems arise. We also refrain from any drug consumption (including alcohol) during the hike and distance ourselves from conspiracy ideologies.
- With the winter hike, we want to bring our demands to the public and make climate justice a topic of conversation. We will therefore accompany the hike with media representatives and photographers.
