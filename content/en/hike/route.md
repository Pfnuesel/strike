## Important Update

The local authorities and police continue to discourage our presence on the cantonal road this year. Negotiations are ongoing, preventing us from confirming the exact route at this time.

Due to the municipality's interference, regrettably, we've had to make time adjustments to our plans!

### Will you be taking the train on Sunday?

We are looking forward to a colorful, loud, peaceful and big protest hike to Davos!
