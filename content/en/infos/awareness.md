_The following text was translated with DeepL_

Awareness is a concept that opposes all forms of discrimination, violence and border crossings. Everyone present should be given barrier-free access to protest. Offensive and border-crossing behaviour, such as sexist, racist, anti-Semitic, queer-hostile, anti-Muslim, ableist, classist or other attacks, will not be tolerated at the Strike WEF hike.

Throughout the protest walk - from Saturday to Sunday - an awareness team will be available and easily recognisable to assist with any problems or forms of discrimination experienced by any of the participants.

You can come to us if you feel uncomfortable, have experienced discriminatory, transgressive or hurtful behaviour, have experienced stressful events or simply need someone to listen to you.

None of us is free from prejudice and discrimination when dealing with others. We can only create a safer space together. For this to succeed, each and every one of us is responsible for reflecting on our own behaviour and our own privileges.
