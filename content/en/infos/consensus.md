### Action consensus WEF hike 2024

To ensure that the winter hike is as safe and accessible as possible for all participants, we have drawn up an action consensus. As an action of peaceful, civil protest against the World Economic Forum (WEF), we must take care of each other and therefore want to base our actions on the following principles:

**We want to have a mindful and sustainable approach to ourselves as a group of activists, which means:** 
: We respect the personal boundaries of other activists.
: We proceed calmly and carefully and endeavour not to endanger anyone (including ourselves).
: We create a regenerative culture by taking care of ourselves and each other in order to act effectively and remain sustainable. 

**Any form of violence is not part of our action.**

**Dealing with the consumption of intoxicants:**
: We make sure that we can act responsibly at all times. Anyone who consumes alcohol or intoxicants does so mindfully and pays attention to the people around them. Before you consume, ask the people around you if it is okay for them. 
  
**Dealing with repression:**
: We constantly inform ourselves about the legal consequences of our actions and take responsibility for them. 
: During and after the hike, we will act in solidarity and support each other if the hike is met with repression and there could be legal consequences.

We distance ourselves from any nationalist symbols and content (no national flags, slogans). 

We are an action of peaceful, civil protest and therefore distance ourselves from any conspiracy ideologies. 

We pay attention to a careful handling of our environment and therefore also a correct handling of rubbish.
