## Route Saturday
### Meeting point
10:00 Küblis

### Schedule
The meeting point is at Küblis train station at 10:00.
Once everyone has gathered, we will hike along the route to Klosters.
There will be several short breaks and a lunch break along the way.

In Klosters, there will be dinner and an evening program.

The evening program will last until **11:00 p.m.**, and the shuttle to Fideris will leave at **8:00 p.m.**!

The last train to Fideris will leave Klosters village at **11:27 p.m.**. As there will probably not be enough seats on the bus, it would be great if people with a GA or GA Night travelcard could take the train. <3 *(Tickets can also be refunded by us)*.

## Route Sunday
### Meeting points
10:30 a.m. Klosters
    or
11:15 Davos Larett

### Schedule
We will meet in Klosters, or if arriving later, in Davos Larett, and then travel together to Davos for the rally.

### Return journey
There will be a special train for participants returning to Landquart at **6:06 p.m.**. This is free of charge.
The Soli-Busses will wait at **Box-Davos**, as they did last year. 
**Important:** Travel there in small groups (2-3 people)! Otherwise, the police will consider larger groups to be a gathering, which has caused problems in recent years.
